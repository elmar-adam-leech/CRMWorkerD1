# Multi-Tenant CRM System

## Overview
This project is a multi-tenant Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed for service-based businesses, particularly HVAC contractors. Its primary purpose is to streamline customer management, job tracking, estimates, lead nurturing, and communication. The system ensures data isolation between tenants, provides robust role-based access control, and allows users to belong to multiple companies with seamless switching. The overarching ambition is to offer a comprehensive, efficient solution for managing business operations.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React with TypeScript and Vite, employing Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for state management. The UI is built with a custom component library based on Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS, inspired by Pipedrive's design with shadcn/ui. It features a mobile-first responsive design, card-based layouts, and light/dark mode theming. A global command palette (`Cmd+K`) and context-aware keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity. All communication actions (call, email, text, schedule) are standardized using centralized components and hooks for consistency.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, offering a RESTful API with consistent error handling. PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations and multi-tenancy. Data validation is enforced using Zod schemas. Authentication uses JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies and bcrypt for password hashing. Role-based access control and strict tenant data segregation are implemented. The system supports multi-contractor users, allowing users to belong to multiple companies via a `user_contractors` junction table, enabling seamless switching and per-contractor roles. Real-time updates are handled via WebSockets. Performance is optimized using strategic database indexing, application caching, and query optimization.

### Feature Specifications
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Complete data isolation and secure access control per tenant.
- **Leads, Estimates & Jobs**: Full CRUD operations with a dual-entity architecture (contacts vs. leads) and real-time updates.
- **Communication & Messaging**: SMS integration via Dialpad API, unified conversation threads, real-time updates, and automatic activity capture.
- **Gmail Integration**: Per-user OAuth for email, encrypted token storage, automatic inbox syncing, and email activity capture.
- **Unified Scheduling System**: Integrates with Housecall Pro, provides a unified calendar view, enforces appointment slots, and uses an auto-assignment algorithm for salespeople.
- **Workflow Automation Builder**: Visual, drag-and-drop builder using React Flow with custom node types (triggers, actions, AI actions, conditionals, delays). Features tag-based filtering, dynamic variables, pre-configured templates, execution logs, and manual testing.

### System Design Choices
